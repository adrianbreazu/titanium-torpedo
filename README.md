# About

IoT Django project for Raspberry Pi 3. It uses a wide range of sensors and actuators. It also provides the PCB schematics for the IoT boards so you can build them yourself.


# PCB design

IoT PCB design can be found in _titanium-torpedo/doc/EaglePCB_ directory. They represent my design (beginner level) any suggestion will be appreciated.


# Hardware needed

1. Raspberry Pi 3 (for better performance)
2. Relay's
3. DS18B20 temperature sensor (used due to accuracy of +/- 0.5)


# Software needed

* Clone this project
* Raspbian-jessie lite


# Installation

1. Cline this project
