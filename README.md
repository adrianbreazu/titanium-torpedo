# About
IoT Django project for Raspberry Pi 3. It uses a wide range of sensors and actuators. It also provides the PCB schematics for the IoT boards so you can build them yourself.

# PCB design
IoT PCB design can be found in _titanium-torpedo/doc/EaglePCB_ directory. They represent my design (beginner level) any suggestion will be appreciated.
